# Weather Forecasting Using Time Series and Machine Learning

## 📌 Objective:

--> To analyze global weather data and build forecasting models to predict temperature trends, using traditional time-series methods.

## 📌 Key Steps:

### 🧹 Data Cleaning:

--> Converted date strings to datetime

--> Handled outliers

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

--> Analyzed correlations between various features like temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation, pressure etc.

--> Visualized trends in temperature and precipitation over time

--> Visualized weather differences across countries

## 📈 Forecasting Models:

1. ARIMA
2. SARIMAX
3. Prophet
4. XGBoost Regressor

## ✅ Evaluation:

--> Compared models using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R²

--> XGBoost gave the best performance with an R² of 0.9983
