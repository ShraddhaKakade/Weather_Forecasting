# Weather Forecasting Using Time Series and Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Objective:

--> To analyze global weather data and build forecasting models to predict temperature trends, using traditional time-series methods.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Steps:

### ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning:

--> Converted date strings to datetime

--> Handled outliers

### ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

--> Analyzed correlations between various features like temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation, pressure etc.

--> Visualized trends in temperature and precipitation over time

--> Visualized weather differences across countries

## ðŸ“ˆ Forecasting Models:

1. ARIMA
2. SARIMAX
3. Prophet
4. XGBoost

## âœ… Evaluation:

--> Compared models using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ²

--> XGBoost gave the best performance with an RÂ² of 0.9983
